# Mars Rover Challenge
## Introduction

***This repository is created for a TypeScript project using Jest for testing. 
The project aims to find an optimal solution for Mars Rovers moving on a Plateau in Mars (the Red Planet).***

## The Task

### Part I - Setting the Scene 

We have been asked to create a program to move rovers around the surface of Mars! ‚ú®
The surface of Mars is represented by a Plateau, we can make the assumption that the Plateau is a square/rectangular grid for the purpose of this task.
Rovers navigate the Plateau so they can use their special cameras üì∑ and robot arms ü¶æ to collect samples back to Planet Earth üåè

#### Representation of a Rover‚Äôs Position on the Plateau

The Plateau is divided into a grid. A Rover‚Äôs position is represented by x and y co-ordinates and the letters N, S, W, E to represent North, South, West, East (the four cardinal compass points) respectively.

#### Example

```
0 0 N
```

This means the Rover is at the bottom-left corner facing in the North direction.
***Nota Bene*** : Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1), and the square directly East from (x, y) is (x + 1, y)


### Part II - Instructing a Rover to Move Around the Plateau


üíª To move a Rover around the Plateau, a string of letters is sent to a Rover.
Here are the letters and their resultant action:

***Nota Bene*** : Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

### Part III - Inputs into the Program

#### First Line of Input to the Program

The first line inputted into the program represents the upper-right coordinates of the Plateau.

```
5 5
```

This Plateau has maximum (x, y) co-ordinates of (5, 5).

***Nota Bene*** : Assume that the lower-left coordinate is (0, 0).

#### Subsequent Lines of Input into the Program - Input to Rovers

This represents the instructions to move the rovers.
Each rover receives two lines of input.

#### First Line of Input to a Rover

The Rover‚Äôs position is represented by two integers representing the X and Y coordinates and a letter representing where the Rover is facing (its orientation).

```
1 2 N
```

#### Second Line of Input to a Rover

A string of letters representing the instructions to move the Rover around the Plateau.

#### Movement Rules

Rovers move sequentially, this means that the first Rover needs to finish moving first before the next one can move.

#### Output

For each Rover, the output represents its final position (final coordinates and where it is facing).



### Part IV - Example Test Case

#### Lines of Input to the Program:


```
5 5

1 2 N

LMLMLMLMM

3 3 E

MMRMMRMRRM

```

#### Expected Output:

```
1 3 N

5 1 E
```

A brief explanation of this example test case is illustrated as below:
